# About MCPT
Mackenzie Computer Programming Team, affectionately known as MCPT, is a group of dedicated individuals focused on furthering their computer science knowledge and competing in programming competitions.  The team consists of 6 branches — junior, game development, intermediate, advanced, girls, and junior girls — with each branch meeting once a week to learn and train.  MCPT students are interested in learning beyond their course material, building their critical thinking skills and being persistent towards improvement.  These students compete in various special events, as well as 5 ranked on-site programming contests each year.  MCPT hopes to open these competitions to other schools for the upcoming cycle.

# Meet the Execs

## Presidents

### Vincent Macri
I remember when I was in grade 9, I found out that my school had a programming team. I immediately made it my goal to one day be one of the team's presidents (mission accomplished!). In grade 10, I was elected by my peers to run Junior CPT, which is when I really started getting involved in the team. In grade 11, I had multiple executive roles and became much more familiar with how the team is run. Now, in grade 12, I have the privilege of leading the Junior branch, running the website, and participating in all parts of CPT.

In CPT, I've met amazing people, including my fellow executives, who are among my closest friends. We all work together to further computer science education at Mackenzie. This year, I'm going to work as hard as I can to make this the best year in the history of CPT at this school.

### Sarah Goldfarb
Before grade nine, I had always been interested in computers and technology. However, I had never actually learned to code. From ICS 2O to my first JDCC to the MCPT Girls Contest, I have continued to learn and grow as a programmer. CPT has always been part of my high school career and I believe it is an amazing opportunity for students to improve their programming, teamwork, and critical thinking skills.

CPT is a club for anyone who wants to learn, compete, or simply have fun programming. I highly recommend it to every student at Mackenzie and I’m excited for the upcoming year!

### Arsh Raza
Joining CPT was one of the best choices I have ever made in my life.  Through CPT I was exposed to competitive programming, one of my favourite hobbies. I find competitive programming very fun because I am able to solve logic-based problems through coding.

This is my first year on the CPT exec team and I hope to help as many students as possible in strengthening their competitive programming skills.

## Vice Presidents

### Richard Yi
After I joined CPT in Grade 9, I cared only about two things: my friends, and competitive programming. I hope that we can train our members to be the best competitive programmers. Long live JDCC!

### Jeffrey Gao
I've always been interested in competitive programming, and CPT has given me a good place to develop and practice my skills through engaging lessons and fun monthly competitions.

### Lev Raizman
Coming into grade 9, my only knoweldge in programming was Scratch. When adding this with my interest in math, putting hard work into ICS got me acceptable results. However, after joining CPT, my eyes were opened to a different way of thinking about any task in programming, making the ICS course significantly easier. Additionally, I found myself a new pastime and passion, and a way to meet and bond with new people. I say that joining CPT is a must for anyone who likes math, logic, and most of all, computers.

## Execs

### Eleanor Robson
CPT has helped me learn to think critically and creatively. Through contests and practice problems, I have become a more persistent problem-solver. More than that, CPT has given me the opportunity to socialize with friends and meet fellow programmers.

### Yuan Yang
I have been a part of CPT for 3 years and enjoyed all the events and lessons held by the club. Last year's Girl's Invitational Contest was the best part! CPT is always enriching and challenging, but this year, it has also become more inclusive and fun.

### Andy Pham
In 9th grade I joined CPT for the lessons and joined the house JDCC competitions. I'm amazed by how much I've learned, just being in a room with enthusiastic members and so many ideas and new concepts flying about. I will never forget my introduction to Bogo, Quantum, and Existentialist Sort (treat yourself, go check them out).

I was inspired to share my knowledge of programming, in the branch I know best: Game Development. This year I'm hyped to help as a Junior Branch exec and teach Game Development alongside my friends Derek and Dereck. We can’t wait to meet you.

### Jaclyn Woon
CPT is my favourite club at Mac. My friends and I always have so much fun at the monthly JDCC competitions.

### Lisa Patrascu
Being a part of CPT has brought me to a level of understanding of programming that I never thought I'd reach. Through the lessons provided and contests offered, I've really been able to hone my technical skills enough to start being creative with my programs and solutions.

### Angela Wang
I've been a part of CPT since grade 10 and I have gained so much from my experience. Not only does CPT have an amazing learning environment where I can expand on my knowledge needed for classes and contests, CPT also has that close team spirit where everyone part of the club has the same goals and ambitions as me. I'm glad to be part of such an incredible team of individuals.

### Cyrus Gandevia
Two years ago, I had absolutely no knowledge or exposure to the field of computer science. Looking back at it, I am simply amazed by how much I have learned and grown as a programmer in these past years. From the intriguing lessons being taught to the contests being offered, CPT has always, and will continue providing me with a challenge to further improve my skills as a programmer.

### Jenny Wu
I started programming about two months before my MaCS entrance exam. I didn't expect to love programming as much as I did. When I came to Mackenzie, the first thing I did was join CPT. I was an unknown loner at contests who eventually had to drop contests to, ironically, practice programming at home. Now, just one year later, I’m an exec with an actual JDCC team. Thank you so much, CPT.

### Jessica Peter
I joined CPT in grade 9, and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. Not only does CPT teach you how to think outside the box and challenge you to improve your programming skills, it also gives you the perfect opportunity to meet new people that have the same interests and goals as you. I'm really glad that I became part of this team so early on, and I would recommend anyone that is even remotely interested in programming to do so as well.

### Derek Zhang
Through CPT, I have been connected with so many amazing programmers who are just as passionate as I am, and the monthly JDCC is always an incredible experience. I have learned so much just by being around like-minded students who see the beauty in programming.

Alongside my friends Dereck, Andy, and Jenny, we can show you this beauty and the fun of programming through Game Development. Feel free to drop by our weekly lessons in Room 220 on Tuesdays!

### Rachel Cummings
Since joining the club in grade 9, CPT has really helped me develop my programming and problem-solving skills outside of the classroom. Within its supportive environment, CPT is a place where I can challenge myself, collaborate with others, learn new and interesting concepts, and creatively tackle tough problems.

### Chloe Nguyen
Over the past 3 years, CPT has not only provided me with knowledge but it has also strengthened my interest for programming. Both encouraging and inviting, the club offers a wonderful environment for those interested in computer science.

### Kimberly Hau
Since joining CPT in grade 9, I've been exposed to many challenges that I wouldn't have otherwise encountered. Being a part of CPT has allowed me to improve my programming skills and learn new concepts through engaging lessons and a supportive environment.
