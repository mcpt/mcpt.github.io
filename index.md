# About MCPT
Mackenzie Computer Programming Team, affectionately known as MCPT, is a group of dedicated individuals focused on furthering their computer science knowledge and competing in programming competitions.  The team consists of 6 branches — junior, game development, intermediate, advanced, girls, and junior girls — with each branch meeting once a week to learn and train.  MCPT students are interested in learning beyond their course material, building their critical thinking skills and being persistent towards improvement.  These students compete in various special events, as well as 5 ranked on-site programming contests each year.  MCPT hopes to open these competitions to other schools for the upcoming cycle.

### Lev Raizman
Coming into grade 9, my only knoweldge in programming was Scratch. When adding this with my interest in math, putting hard work into ICS got me acceptable results. However, after joining CPT, my eyes were opened to a different way of thinking about any task in programming, making the ICS course significantly easier. Additionally, I found myself a new pastime and passion, and a way to meet and bond with new people. I say that joining CPT is a must for anyone who likes math, logic, and most of all, computers.

After I joined CPT in Grade 9, I cared only about two things: my friends, and competitive programming. I hope that we can train our members to be the best competitive programmers. Long live JDCC!
