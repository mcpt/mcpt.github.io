# About MCPT
Mackenzie Computer Programming Team, affectionately known as MCPT, is a group of dedicated individuals focused on furthering their computer science knowledge and competing in programming competitions.  The team consists of 6 branches — junior, game development, intermediate, advanced, girls, and junior girls — with each branch meeting once a week to learn and train.  MCPT students are interested in learning beyond their course material, building their critical thinking skills and being persistent towards improvement.  These students compete in various special events, as well as 5 ranked on-site programming contests each year.  MCPT hopes to open these competitions to other schools for the upcoming cycle.

## Presidents

### Lev Raizman
Being president of CPT has been my goal since I joined the club in grade 9. Over the last three years, I have seen how much people benefit from this club, and am hoping to provide the same experience to members this year. When it comes to programming, I personally prefer practical applications over competitive ones. Of course, the club is focused on competitive programming. Aside from programming, I also enjoy math and chess, as well as debate (you can also find me in all those clubs).

### Richard Yi
Whether it is learning or teaching at CPT, I enjoy competitive programming. My notable achievements include cheesing the 5-point subtask in CCC18S5 and not choking at ECOO18R1.

## Heads

### Emily Hu
I've learned so much about programming (and how to pass my ICS courses) from CPT since joining in grade 9. I've met some great friends through this club and I hope you will too! I'm honored to be a part of the executive team. Let's make this year better than ever!

### Yuan Yang
Hey, I'm Yuan and I'm the head of girls junior. I have been in CPT since grade 9 and had a great time in it. In my free time, I code, art and read. Programming is the most inspiring and rewarding experience for me. That's why I want to share this joy with you, by helping you in your studies. I hope one day we'll have free breakfast at Google together.

### Matthew Mach
I've always been interested in programming. When I was offered a chance to create problems as an executive of MCPT, I jumped at the opportunity. At first, I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy writing computer science problems as I normally do math. But as I continued, I enjoyed the different aspects of computer contest. And the more I enjoyed it, the more I wanted to do for the club. So, I decided to apply for the head of problem development and got in. I’m looking forward to creating more fun and interesting problems for Mackenzie!
