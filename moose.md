In preparation for the upcoming CCC and ECOO contest, we are pleased to offer an online practice round with our judge. Consider this an invitation.
<br>
<br>
Every month William Lyon Mackenzie C.I. runs an after-school programming contest for students from our school who compete in teams against each other. The contest proved to be an invaluable tool for student’s preparation for programming contests. We have been fortunate to have the Senior contest problems written by past alumni including **Reyno Tilikaynen**. Reyno is currently a student at Waterloo and also contributed to the problem sets for ECOO 2017-2018 and ECOO 2018-2019 (Regional and Provincial rounds). The junior contest problems have been written by problem writers from Mackenzie’s Computer Programming Team. Writers in both divisions have ample experience with problem writing.

<br>
<br>
<h4> Dates </h4>
For the month of December, we have decided to open the contest to teams outside of Mackenzie. These teams will compete against each other, separately from Mackenzie’s teams.
<br>
<br>
The contest will run on **December 18, 2018.** The contest starts at 9:00:00 and ends at 15:05:00. Teams will get two and a half hours from the moment they start. Please note that if you start the contest after 12:35:00, the contest will end before your two and a half hours pass, and you will lose any time remaining in your two and a half hours.

<br>
<br>
<h4> Registration </h4>

**Please register [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdzS2OTaePGJ8Re4-WR7MJ0p1jdIludjmIb8pI0wDxi94TrJA/viewform) or at the bottom of the page** by **17:00:00 on December 15**. Instructions on how to fill in the registration form are in the form. If you have several teams to register, register each one separately. 
<br>
<br>
Each team may participate in only one of the competitions. **LATE REGISTRATIONS MAY NOT BE ACCEPTED**, due to the time necessary to set up an account for your team. Once all teams have registered, additional information on how the judge works, and how to access it will be sent out to teams.

## Rules
 - The contest must be written under teacher supervision.
 - Teams may not have more than four students. At least two students are recommended.
 - No communication between teams is allowed during the contest.
 - Only ~1~ computer can be used for writing code. An additional computer can be used to access other online or offline resources.
 - Allowed online resources are the judge and language documentation
 - All other online resources are not allowed
 - All clarification requests must either be submitted through the clarification system built into the judge, **or** by email to the aforementioned persons.
 - Any offline resources prepared before the contest, whether printed or not, are allowed
 - Making submissions to the judge in an attempt to learn the test cases or to earn points without solving the problem will result in an immediate ban from the contest.
 - You must act ethically during the contest; any unethical behaviour (as determined by contest supervisors) will be grounds for disqualification. Appeals can be made to Mrs. Krasteva (mskrasteva@gmail.com or valentina.krasteva@tdsb.on.ca).


## Scoring

Scoring happens as follows:

 - You will get points for every batch completed. Batches will consist of ~1~ or more test cases. To complete a batch, all test cases in that batch must be correctly answered.
 - Completing all batches will result in a score of ~100~ points.
 - An additional ~10~ points are granted for a successful AC (Accepted) on the first attempt.
 - A time bonus is given, based on how much time has elapsed. The sooner you submit, the bigger the time bonus. The time bonus is then multiplied by your score divided by ~100~.
   - Formula: ~S = \lfloor{T+\frac{m}{5} \times \frac{T}{100}}\rfloor{}~, where ~S~ is your final score, ~T~ is the number of points you got on the problem, ~m~ is the number of minutes remaining in the contest, and ~\lfloor{Z}\rfloor{}~ represents the largest integer less than ~Z~.
 - Some problems will have sample test cases. Failing these sample test cases will result in an automatic ~0~ on the submission.
 - No accommodations can be made for malfunctioning technology or the inability to participate on the day of the contest.
